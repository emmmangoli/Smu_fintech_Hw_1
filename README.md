Affirms customers can pay over time with term lengths from six weeks to 60 months. Split pay, Affirm’s biweekly pay-in-4 option, is always interest-free. Affirm’s monthly payment options can be interest-free or interest-bearing with simple interest ranging from a 0% to 30% APR. Simple interest means the interest is based on a fixed percentage that never compounds, so customers never owe a penny more than what they agree to at checkout.

# Business activities:

Affirm works best on the app. Though founded in 2012, Affirm wants to be the future of commerce and payments through its innovative, proprietary business model. By using an AI-based algorithm to do a soft pull on a customer’s credit report as opposed to a hard pull.

With 12.7 million active consumers and 207.000 active merchants. Affirm has two main competitors are Klarna and Afterpay. But it has an advantage of them in the sense that it also offers the affirm card.

Affirm card is gives you the flexibility to pay now and over time without any of the fees or compound interest. Affirm has 14 registered patents and 37 trademarks of intellectual property. Cloud based technologies, artificial intelligence and machine learning are key aspects that makes its integration with merchants wonderful. This AI based algorithm boasts of approving customers.

Affirms business model for the customer is in four parts. And they are:
-	Point of sale financing
-	Virtual card
-	Split it
-	Saving accord (affirm card).

*Point of sale financing*: I’ll explain this with an example of Jonathan. Jonathan is a middle-aged man that walks into Walmart. After shopping and at checkout, Jonathan was prompted to pay for the laptop with different forma pf payment and Affirm is one of them. Jonathan selected to pay for the laptop with Affirm. After 5 clicks, Jonathan was approved for the loan. And prompted to select the term of the loan.

*Virtual card*: the virtual card can be used in 4 different steps. A customer fills up there shopping cart. Then heads over to the Affirm app, search for the retailer and request for ho much they want to get approved for. Once approved, the customer selects his/her loan term and Affirm generates a virtual credit card at the retailers site. 

*Split it*: This applies for purchase that are less than $250 at certain retailers and merchants.

*Saving account (Affirm card)*: A savings account that yields 1% interest rate.

*How Affirm makes money from customers*: Affirm makes money through customers by charging simple interest. Some merchants charge 0% APR, otherwise Affirm charges 0-30% APR. there is always no late fee.

*How Affirm makes money from merchants*: When a customer selects to pay with Affirm, the merchant pays Affirm a certain percentage of the transaction.

# Landscape: 
Affirm is in the personal credit domain. Over the last 5-10 years, this domain has seen some key players like Klarna, Afterpay, Sezzle, Quadpay etc., spring up. But its sustainability lies in the consumer spending and confidence in the economy.

Affirm has stores like Amazon, Walmart, Target etc., in its merchant like. These stores are frequented by millennials, thus further making it easy for the customer to have a worry-free checkout. On the part of the merchant, affirm would check for credit worthiness and underwrite the loan. Just like Affirm offers four interest-free payments, so does Afterpay who offers four interest-free payments over six weeks.

# Results:
according to www.ggoogle.com, Affirm makes money through four revenue streams: network revenue, interest income, gains on sales of loans, and servicing income. But when compared to the industry standard and competitors, Klarna is tops it. Klarna tops Affirm in the sense that it lets customers split purchases into four interest free payment, pay in 30 days or sign up for 36 months financing. As at the time of writing this, Affirm is down 54% since IPO.

*Advantage of Affirm*:
-	No interest.
-	Has virtual card.
-	No hidden fees.
-	No down payment.

*Disadvantages of using Affirm*:
-	Does not report to all three credit bureaus.
-	Interest rate is based on credit worthiness

# Recommendation:
I would advise the Affirm to start offering credit cards, because the company already has a debit card with installment payment. Since the company benefits from both customer and merchant, I would advise the company to lower its intertest rate and not charge any last fees. Offering a few select credit cards for the millennial and reducing fees would make them more competitive in a consumer centered market. 

The affordability of these goods also pays a key factor too. But Affirm says that it helps customers save money. Apps with clean and easy to navigate UI gets more attention. Although Affirm offers real-time decision making to decide, when the AI based algorithm cannot decide, instead of referring it for further consideration, it declines. 

So, I would recommend that instead of outrightly declining customers application, a special department is created where customers are reconsidered for credit. That is, another attempt at getting that business. 

Affirm does a soft pull of customers credit, but only report some loans to Experian. I would recommend that all late and delinquent loans be reported to not just Experian but all credit ber.
